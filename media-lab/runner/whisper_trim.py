"""Trim a TTS wav to exactly the requested line using word timestamps.

Chatterbox cloned-voice generations run away past the line into re-phrasings
(the alignment force-EOS is bypassed for cloned conds). Silence-gap trimming
misses it — the repeats flow without pauses. The founder film's fix: transcribe
with faster-whisper, find where the TARGET text ends, cut there.

Usage: whisper_trim.py <in.wav> <line.txt> <out.wav>
Exit 0 with out.wav written on success (even if no trim was needed);
non-zero = caller keeps the original.
