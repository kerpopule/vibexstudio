"""Media Lab queue watchdog — detects a stalled queue and self-heals.

Run by media-lab-queue-watchdog.timer every 2 minutes. Stdlib only.

What it protects against (each one has actually happened):
  A. Worker thread dead/blocked: jobs queued, nothing running, for 2+ checks.
     -> restart media-lab-simple.service (safe: nothing is running).
     (2026-08-16: a hung Apple web-push with no timeout blocked the worker;
      16 jobs sat "queued" until a human noticed.)
  B. A running job wedged: same job id + stage unchanged for > STALL_RUNNING_MIN.
     -> restart the app; the app marks the job "studio restarted mid-take — hit
     Retry". The interruption is logged loudly.
  C. App unreachable while the service claims active -> restart.
  D. GPU pool lock not held after a reboot -> pool_lock.sh acquire (idempotent).

State between runs lives in watchdog-state.json next to this script's data dir.
Never restarts more often than RESTART_COOLDOWN_MIN.
