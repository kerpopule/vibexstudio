"""Clear the harmless kind of GPU recovery hold, through the sanctioned tool only.

Run by media-lab-hold-autorecover.timer every 5 minutes. Stdlib only.

A controller restart while a warm engine is parked leaves the durable lease in
``recovery`` with reason ``owner-exited`` (or ``controller-restarted``) and a
``gpu-recovery-hold.json`` marker. Nothing is wrong with the GPU: the owner
simply went away. Until 2026-09 every such hold waited for a person (6.5 to
67.5 hours each) and helpers improvised unsafe clears (deleting the lease row
or the marker by hand). This script is the one sanctioned self-heal:

* it acts ONLY on a startup hold (marker reason ``durable-lease-recovery:
  owner-exited`` / ``...:controller-restarted``, no job in the marker) whose
  durable row says the same, on the SAME boot, for a jobless residency lease
  (``idle-restore-*`` / ``internal-*``) or a parked lease whose job is finished;
* only when the hold is at least 10 minutes old (a person gets the first
  chance), no job is running (asked of the studio itself), no operator baton or
  engine-maintenance marker exists, the H3 safety stop and memwatch latch are
  absent, the control-plane guard heartbeat is current and ready/monitoring,
  the old owner process is gone, and MemAvailable is above a floor;
* its only action is ``tools/reconcile-gpu-recovery.py --job-id <lease job>``,
  the same exact-proof tool an operator runs;
* limits: one attempt per hold, at most 3 attempts per 24 h, a backoff of
  10 min / 30 min / 2 h after failures, and after 2 consecutive failures (or a
  hold it already tried) it writes ``pool/autorecover-gaveup.json`` and stops
  acting until a person removes that file. The health check alerts on it.

A second, narrower class (owner-approved, 2026-09-26): a **guard trip during
an H3 cold load**. The control-plane guard stops a cold load when memory
pressure crosses its limit; the studio then records ``operation-uncertain`` for
the load, and the guard leaves ``safety-stop.json`` plus the memwatch latch.
Every such hold since 09-17 waited hours for a person, who then checked memory
and ran the same reconcile. This script does that only when ALL of these hold:

* the safety stop is a guard pressure trip (``memory-psi`` / ``low-memavailable``
  / ``swap-growth``) of ``media-lab-sol-h3`` on THIS boot, its incident receipt
  says the H3 cgroup was fully terminated, and the latch (if any) names the
  same incident;
* the durable lease is H3, still in phase ``load`` (nothing was rendered), its
  reason equals the hold's ``operation-uncertain:*`` reason, and the load
  record in ``pool/h3-load-pressure.jsonl`` says that very load ended
  ``guard-lost`` around the trip time;
* the tripped job (if any) ended ``error``/``cancelled`` with no output, so a
  clear never re-runs it (the family presses Retry, as today);
* the trip is at least 15 min old, H3 is not running, MemAvailable is back to
  at least 90 GiB, PSI full avg60 is at most 2, and the kernel log since the
  trip shows no Xid / hung task / soft lockup / OOM kill;
* at most ONE guard-trip clear per 24 h (a second trip in a day means something
  is really wrong: it gives up and the health watch alerts).

Its action: preserve the evidence (``.backups/autorecover-trip-<time>/``), move
the safety stop and latch into that folder, wait for the guard to report
``ready``, then run the same reconcile tool. If anything fails the markers are
put back, so the box is exactly as held as before.

It never touches other ``operation-uncertain`` holds (a failure mid-render),
safety stops from a render, ``boot-changed`` holds, or anything while a job
runs. Off unless MEDIA_LAB_HOLD_AUTORECOVER=1 (config/local.env).

A third, tiny job (MEDIA_LAB_H3_CACHE_TRIM=1): with no hold at all, when the
idle H3 restore is refused for a hair of memory ("h3 decode requires 117.0 GiB
...; 116.9 GiB would be available", seen 2026-09-26 20:38-20:48 after a clean
recovery), the box is idle and H3 is not running, it writes the page cache out
of the way (sync + drop the CLEAN page cache, `vm.drop_caches=1`) so the
restore's next try fits. At most every 30 min and 12 times a day. It needs
`sudo -n` for exactly `tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches`.

A fourth class (owner decision, 2026-09-27: "it's supposed to come back by
itself"): **after any reboot**, planned or not, the studio clears H3 for the
new boot and the carried-over ``boot-changed`` hold itself, with the same
evidence a person saw in ``spark1-clear-h3`` (MEDIA_LAB_BOOT_AUTOCLEAR=1):

* it first preserves the previous boot's evidence (the end of its journal and
  kernel log, pstore, the hold, the lease row, any safety stop and the newest
  guard incident) in ``.backups/autorecover-boot-<time>/``;
* only when: the box has been up 2 min, no memwatch latch and no safety stop
  from THIS boot, the control-plane guard is current and ready, the GPU answers
  ``nvidia-smi``, the kernel log of this boot has no Xid / hung task / soft
  lockup / OOM kill, MemAvailable >= 90 GiB and PSI full avg60 <= 2, no job is
  running, no operator baton, and the hold (if any) is one the reconcile tool
  can clear exactly (jobless, a finished parked take, or a take the reboot
  interrupted, which the tool ends as an error and never re-runs);
* its action: write ``boot-clearance.json`` for this boot (the old one is kept)
  and, when a hold carried over, run the same reconcile tool. A safety stop
  from the PREVIOUS boot is moved into the evidence folder first.
* limits: 3 tries per boot with a 5 / 15 min backoff, at most 3 cleared boots
  per 24 h (a reboot loop gives up), and if it is still not cleared 45 min
  after boot it gives up. Giving up writes ``pool/autorecover-gaveup.json``
  with the reason, and the health watch alerts Steve with that reason; it
  never waits silently. ``spark1-clear-h3`` stays as the manual override.
