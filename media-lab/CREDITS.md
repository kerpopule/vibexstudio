# Credits

Media Lab stands on a lot of great work. Some of this attribution is
required by licenses; most of it is here because we believe in crediting
what we build on, whether required or not.

## Engines & models (referenced, not bundled)

No model weights ship in this repository. The studio orchestrates engines the
owner installs and licenses themselves. Engines whose licence is personal,
non-commercial, research-only or territory-restricted are **off by default**
and marked "personal / non-commercial" in the studio; a host opts in per engine
(`MEDIA_LAB_PERSONAL_ENGINES` in `config/local.env`). The full table, with
links to each licence, is [docs/ENGINE-LICENCES.md](docs/ENGINE-LICENCES.md).

- **Maestro / WanGP** by deepbeepmeep — the video-engine runtime our H3
  engine container is a pinned fork of.
- **MiniMax H3** — video generation model, under MiniMax's own H3 licence
  (restricted; off by default). This repo contains integration code, never
  the model.
- **LTX-2 / LTX-2.5** by Lightricks — fast video drafts, under the LTX-2
  Community License (commercial use free below a revenue threshold).
- **YuE2** by M-A-P — music with editable scores. Code Apache-2.0; weights
  CC BY-NC 4.0 (non-commercial; off by default).
- **MiniMax Music 3** — music, under the MiniMax Music 3 Community License.
- **FLUX.1 Kontext [dev]** by Black Forest Labs — likeness-keeping image
  edits, under the FLUX.1 [dev] Non-Commercial License (off by default).
- **Qwen-Image / Qwen-Image-Edit** by Qwen (Alibaba) — image generation and
  editing, Apache-2.0.
- **Qwen-Image-2.1** by Qwen (Alibaba) — the studio host's image engine
  (generation, editing, transparency). Released under the Qwen Research
  License: research or evaluation use only, and commercial use requires a
  separate license from Qwen (off by default).
- **HunyuanVideo-Avatar** by Tencent — audio-driven avatars, under the
  Tencent Hunyuan Community License (territory limits; off by default).
- **ACE-Step**, **Wan2.2**, **Chatterbox**, **TripoSR**, **BiRefNet** — the
  studio host's music, video, speech, 3D and background-removal engines
  (Apache-2.0 / MIT).
- **ComfyUI** and its node ecosystem — image and music pipelines.
- **fal.ai** — optional cloud rendering provider (bring your own key).

## Ideas & prior art

- **minimax-h3-prompt-composer** by BMB12d3 — camera-path planning and H3
  prompt-composition ideas informed our tooling. That repo has no license,
  so we adapted ideas only, never code.
- **MiniMax H3's style skills** (github.com/MiniMax-AI/MiniMax-H3) inspired
  the "Official H3 templates" shelf. The prompt prefixes are our own words;
  the skills' example animations are not redistributed here (their repository
  carries no licence), so a fresh studio shows an emoji tile instead.
- The **malcolmrey** community character index informed the known-characters
  picker. No character catalog ships here: a studio may keep its own in its
  gitignored local overlay (docs/LOCAL-OVERLAY.md). Mind likeness and
  trademark rights before you do.
- Countless prompt techniques came from the open AI-video community on X.

## Image template collection

`static/template-library/` holds prompt records and example images from
[freestylefly/awesome-gpt-image-2](https://github.com/freestylefly/awesome-gpt-image-2)
(MIT for the project's code and data). The examples are other people's work:
as that project itself says, its MIT licence does not grant commercial rights
to each third-party prompt or image. Treat them as learning references and ask
the original author before commercial use. See
`static/template-library/NOTICE.md`.

## Design & type

- **Space Grotesk** by Florian Karsten and **Barlow** by Jeremy Tribby —
  both under the SIL Open Font License, served via Google Fonts.
- The Co-Agent NOIR design language is our own (co-agent.us).

## Foundation

- **FastAPI**, **Uvicorn**, **Pydantic** — the server.
- The original `media-lab-simple` was built for a single NVIDIA DGX Spark,
  and this studio keeps that heritage.

If you see your work here uncredited, open an issue — we'll fix it.
