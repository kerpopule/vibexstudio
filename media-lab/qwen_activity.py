"""Fail-closed Qwen activity probing for residency admission.

The Qwen service exposes scheduler gauges on ``/metrics`` as Prometheus text,
not JSON.  Port 8003 is an OpenAI-compatible shim for the authoritative
runtime on port 8004, so activity admission samples the canonical runtime once
and records the shim as skipped rather than double-counting it.
