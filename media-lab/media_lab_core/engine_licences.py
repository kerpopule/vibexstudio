"""Model licences of the engines Media Lab can drive, and the public defaults.

A fresh install must only offer engines anyone may use, including commercially.
Engines whose weights carry a personal, non-commercial, research-only or
territory-restricted licence are therefore OFF by default: the studio refuses
their jobs with a plain message and the page shows them greyed out with a
"personal / non-commercial" badge. A host whose use fits the licence opts in
per engine in its gitignored config/local.env:

    MEDIA_LAB_PERSONAL_ENGINES=yue2,kontext      # or: all

The licence facts here are summaries for the UI; the licence texts linked from
docs/ENGINE-LICENCES.md are what binds. Whoever enables an engine accepts its
licence themselves. Stdlib only (the runner scripts import local_config).
