"""Door codes a family can actually type: a few everyday words.

Media Lab has exactly two codes:

* the **family code** -- one shared code for everyone in the house. It opens
  one permission set: make things, edit them, use and tidy the Library. Every
  device that enters it once stays signed in for a year;
* the **admin code** -- the owner's own, longer code. On top of everything the
  family can do it changes server settings: provider keys, engine installs,
  GPU profiles, and rotating the family code.

Both are random words from ``WORDS`` joined with dashes, e.g.
``maple-otter-lantern-comet``. Four words from a list this size is about 40
bits: with the gate's per-device backoff that is out of reach of online
guessing, and it is still something a grandparent can read off a fridge note.
The admin code uses six words (about 60 bits).

Typing is forgiving. Case, spaces, dashes, dots, commas and underscores are
ignored when the code is checked, so "Maple Otter lantern-COMET" opens the same
door as "maple-otter-lantern-comet". Codes minted before this module existed
(8 letters, or a 4-digit admin code) contain no separators, so they compare
exactly as before and every existing device keeps working until the owner
rotates.

Standard library only: install.sh and the CLI run it without a virtualenv.
